For demonstration purposes I am going to use the 'https://breakingbadapi.com/' api service to get a list of Characters and navigate to detail screen.

Libraries I will be using in this project are

Retrofit - For api calls
Dagger - Dependency injection
Jetpack navigation UI - For navigating between fragments
Picasso - for retreiving the images

Will be implementing using MVVM architecture, Coroutines, Livedata, viewBinding
