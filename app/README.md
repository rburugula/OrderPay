For demonstration purposes I am going to use the 'https://breakingbadapi.com/' api service to get a list of Characters and navigate to detail screen.

Libraries I will be using in this project are

Retrofit - For api calls
Dagger - Dependency injection
Jetpack navigation UI - For navigating between fragments
Picasso - for retreiving the images

Will be implementing using MVVM architecture, Coroutines, Livedata, viewBinding

This projet is to mainly demonstrate the architecture and the use of latest techstack and only
has very basic UI
Couple of things which I will be doing if I spend more time
Make the UI look pretier, at the moment it is very very basic
Need to add more unit tests on the Live data and modify the coroutinescope in unit tests
